🗑️ Jankyard

Welcome to the Jankyard.

This is a digital salvage yard for random code snippets, text files, half-baked ideas, and things that didn't fit anywhere else. It is not polished, it is not optimized, and it is definitely not production-ready.

It is, however, highly likely to contain:

Python scripts that solve problems I don't remember having.

Text files with drafts, notes, or ASCII art.

CSS experiments that break on mobile.

One-off utility functions.

📂 What's Inside?

The contents of this repository are subject to change without notice, reason, or warning. Currently, you might find:

Code: Snippets in various languages (Python, JS, C++, etc.) that needed a home.

Text: Random thoughts, todo lists, or copy-pasta.

Jank: Code that works, but we're not sure why or how.
