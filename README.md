# 🗑️ The Jankyard
### Welcome to the digital salvage yard.

This repository is a collection of random code snippets, text files, half-baked ideas, and things that didn't fit anywhere else. It is not polished, it is not optimized, and it is definitely not production-ready.

### Contents likely include:

*  🐍 Python scripts that solve problems I don't remember having.

* 📝 Text files with drafts, notes, or questionable ASCII art.

* 🛠️ One-off utility functions that work on my machine (probably).

* 🤖 AI-generated code committed without checking, proofreading, or distinct regard for human safety.
